# PROJECT DEPRECATED/ABANDONED
#indexgen-lib

[![NPM](https://nodei.co/npm/indexgen-lib.png?downloads=true)](https://nodei.co/npm/indexgen-lib/)

This is the core library backing indexgen command line tool. The reason it has been decoupled is to improve the old monolitic script while making it easier for testing and also to have this library as a dependency for other tools as grunt-indexgen grunt plugin (currently under development).

#Roadmap
- Full test coverage.
- Add support for a more expressive `igignore.json` format. It would be nice to fully support the json format so you can what directories to exclude in a more natural way.

#Suggestions
Please leave me any suggestion you may have in this project github repo.
They are very welcome!
